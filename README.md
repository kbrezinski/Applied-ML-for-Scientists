This repository contains lecture materials, notebooks, and resources for the graduate-level course **Applied Machine Learning for Scientists**.  
The course emphasizes **practical ML workflows**: framing scientific problems, preparing data, building and evaluating models, deploying systems, and monitoring them in real-world contexts.  
We also integrate **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for coding, editing, and scientific writing support.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/applied-ml-scientists.git
cd applied-ml-scientists
```


### 2. Set up a virtual environment with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended)
Using **Python 3.12+**:
```bash
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Or, open the notebooks directly in **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)** by uploading them.
